## 🗄️ [Shell Scripts](Shellscripts)

1. 📜 [script1.sh](Shellscripts/Lab11/script1.sh)

```
Write a script takes two arguments a and b and output their sum, difference, multiplication and division.
```

2. 📜 [script2.sh](Shellscripts/Lab11/script2.sh)

```
Write a script that will shutdown system in 60 secs using single command.
```

3. 📜 [script3.sh](Shellscripts/Lab11/script3.sh)

```
Write a script to create your own move command, it will take two arguments as input: source and destination.
```

4. 📜 [script4.sh](Shellscripts/Lab11/script4.sh)

```
Write a script to create your own cd command, It will take only one argument as input i.e. path you want to change your directory to.
```

5. 📜 [script1.sh](Shellscripts/Lab13/script1.sh)

```
Create a script to count total number of files, directories and ordinary files in a PWD if no argument is given, if argument is given, it will count in that particular path.
```

6. 📜 [script1.sh](Shellscripts/Lab14/script1.sh)

```

## 🗄️ [C Scripts](Cscripts)

1. 📜 [task1.c](Cscripts/Lab16/task1.c)

```
Including the initial parent process, how many processes are created in the below program?
```

2. 📜 [task2.c](Cscripts/Lab16/task2.c)

```
Using the given program, identify the values A, B, C, and D. (assume the actual pids of the  parent and child are 2600 and 2603, respectively).
```

3. 📜 [task3.c](Cscripts/Lab16/task3.c)

```
Find out errors in the given program correct them and explain what the output will be at line A.
```

4. 📜 [demo.c](Cscripts/Lab17/demo.c)

```
Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates the Fibonacci sequence in the child process. The number of the sequence will be provided in the command line. For example, if 5 is provided, the first five numbers in the Fibonacci sequence will be output by the child process. Because the parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke the wait()call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that anon-negative number is passed on the command line.
```

## 🗄️ [C++ Scripts](CPPscripts)

1. 📜 [demo.cpp](CPPscripts/Lab18/demo.cpp)

```
Write a C++ code using pthread library that performs the following actions:

Take two integer a and b inputs from User.

Create four threads:
    1st thread will calculate their sum
    2nd thread will calculate their difference
    3rd thread will calculate their product
    4th thread will give their squares

Sum, difference, product, squares should be displayed in main method

Hint: Use Global declaration of variables for access.
```
