## ✔️ [Lab 17](Lab17)

1. 📜 [demo.c](Cscripts/Lab17/demo.c)

```
Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates the Fibonacci sequence in the child process. The number of the sequence will be provided in the command line. For example, if 5 is provided, the first five numbers in the Fibonacci sequence will be output by the child process. Because the parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke the wait()call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that anon-negative number is passed on the command line.
